## Overview

This version of the application is written in Python, which is used to crack the restriction passcode of an iPhone/iPad takes advantage of a flaw in unencrypted backups allowing the hash and salt to be discovered.

## DEPENDENCIES

This has been tested with [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-271/) and [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/)

Requires [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) Install with `pip install requests`

## Usage

    usage: ioscrack.py [-h] [-c] [--mojave] [-b folder]

    a script to crack the restriction passcode of an iDevice

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c, --cli             prompts user for input
    -m, --mojave              helps user run script on macOS mojave
    -b folder, --backup folder
                        where backups are located

## How to Use

1.  Clone repository

    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/thehappydinoa/iOSRestrictionBruteForce && cd iOSRestrictionBruteForce
    ```

2.  Make sure to use [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) or [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice) to backup the iOS device to computer

3.  Run `ioscrack.py`

         python ioscrack.py

## How It Works

Done by cracking the [pbkdf2](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2898.txt) hash with my lambda function using Passlib

1.  Trys the [top 20 four-digit](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html) pins

2.  Trys birthdays between 1000-(50 years into the future)

3.  Brute force pins from 1 to 9999

4.  Adds successful pins to local database

## How to Protect Against

1.  Encrpyt backups

2.  Backup only on trusted computers

## Notes

You may have trouble accessing `~/Library/Application\ Support/MobileSync/Backup/` on macOS Mojave and higher as SIP (System Integrity Protection) prevents programatic access to that folder. The way around this is to copy the folder `Backup` from the above path to the `iOSRestrictionBruteForce` folder then run `python ioscrack.py -b Backup`. Or run `python ioscrack.py --mojave`
